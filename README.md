“Management is, above all, a practice where art, science, and craft meet.” –Henry Mintzberg
A business and management academic and author, Henry Mintzberg, has studied management and has found that there is not one magic bullet that shoots through all the skills needed to run a successful project. It’s a practice made up of many disciplines. You can be an expert at the textbook definition of a dozen methodologies, or an intuitive leader who manages from the gut, but if you lean too heavily on one or the other, you’re never going to fully realize your potential.

Management is not a science, nor is it an art or craft, and yet it features aspects of all three. Think of management as a Venn diagram, and management is where the circles for art, science and craft meet. You need to be methodical, always scheduling and budgeting according to a planned structure. But that plan isn’t going to take place in some abstract realm. There are outside influences that will impact it, not to mention the project is executed by people, and people are notoriously difficult to place in box. There’s a bit of artistry involved in maneuvering through a project, that is to say: be flexible and use everything at your disposal.
